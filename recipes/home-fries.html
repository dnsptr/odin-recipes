    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These home fries turn out crispy every time. They're great for breakfast or as a side dish. If you prefer crispy hash browns, use shredded potatoes (instead of cubed) and follow the recipe directions.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse potato cubes with cold water and drain well.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place potatoes in the skillet and season with salt and pepper; mix well. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and cook, turning frequently, until brown and crisp on all sides, about 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
